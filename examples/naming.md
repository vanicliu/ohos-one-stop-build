# Example: Skill Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for skill directory names.
- Name must match the SKILL.md `name` field.
- Prefix with domain/platform when helpful (e.g. ohos-*, android-*, ios-*).
- Keep names short and aligned with the description keywords.

Examples:
- ohos-one-stop-build
- ohos-log-tail
- harmonyos-build-run
